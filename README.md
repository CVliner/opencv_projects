### OpenCV Learning Guide

This repository is designed to help you learn and practice OpenCV with real projects, a powerful open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks.

### Introduction
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and accelerates the use of machine perception in commercial products.

This guide will cover the basics of OpenCV, including image processing, video analysis, object detection, and more.

### Prerequisites
Before starting with OpenCV, make sure you have a basic understanding of:
- Python programming
- Computer vision concepts
- Basic knowledge of NumPy (recommended)

### Installation
To start using OpenCV, you need to install the library. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless   # For environments without GUI
